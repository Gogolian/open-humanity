# Do you want to live forever?

## TL;DR;
An Open Source Project that will, gather consensual info from people about traits of their characters, views and beliefs, to build a database, that can be used to build chatbots: digital replicas. Saving humanity before they disappear.

# Open Humanity
## An early attempt to save as many minds as possible

## Problem
People unfortuneatly die. As of witing that readme, we have no way to live past our 80's, 90's or 100's. As we might see advances in longevity in the future, as of now, we have to assume the inevitalble.

Yet almost every one of us would like to leave behind some part of ourselves in this world. That's why we do art, write books, and do anything we can to make a small impact on this world.

Our Grand-grandparents left us diaries.

Our Grandparents left us Photos.

Our Parents left us Videos.

Now, we have an ability, to leave our future generations something else.

## Solution

You might have already heard stories about people being turned to chatbots:

As the technology is right here and now,

## All it needs is data!

And we can actually provide that.

This project is not yet about code, although it eventually will be.

Right now, I invite everyone, but especially Psychologists, Sociologists and Philosophers in an attempt to create a...

## Questions List

The list, in its perfect form would contain a set of questions that when answered by the individual, would be sufficient to feed to the "Chatbot making algorithm" to create a persona as likely to you as possible.

The persona will never be exactly 100% same, yet my quess is that with advances in AI it will be sufficiently close.

Even if all fails and the world collapses, one, can still leave their grandchildren answers to most philosophic or mind boggling questions, to see how their Grandpa, or Grandma responded.

## About the format

We submit new questions through pull requests.

all questions should be submitted in english in txt format, with a unique file name, hinting what the question is about, or just a random unique string to avoid filname crashes.

We submit to either `/questions/uncategorized` directory. Where questions will await categorization. With an exception of `NSFW` questions that should go straight to `/questions/nsfw` folder.

If You feel like you know that your question should be inside a category that is not yet created, go on and create that category in `/questions` folder.

## How to use

This project is extreamly early stage, I litteraly just posted this readme file.

That means that if you want to use it, clone this repo to your computer, make a folder `/answers` and start answering all questions.

In my opinion VScode will help you greatly with browsing the questions, but feel free to use any text editor to your liking.

Once you're done, BACKUP THOSE ANSWERS! Now, congratulations, you've just built up information database, that can be feeded into bot generation program, and build a bot that will hopefully answer just like you do.

You can either leave it like it is, check up on our #OpenHumanity updates, or play around with tools like: https://botmake.io/, https://www.appypie.com/chatbot/builder or ChatGPT.

In `/instructions` folder you are free to add instructions for how can you use `/answers` to turn them to chatbots, either with the tools I provided, or with ones I know nothing about.

Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/GZNdrpfk and submit your opinions and findings.

All the best!

Cheers!
