# Do you want to live forever?

## Super TL;DR;
Humanity Backup.

## IMPORTANT UPDATE! FIRST WORKING VERSION!
## YOU OWN THE DATA! NOTHING IS SENT ANYWHERE!

## How to use:
1. Clone or download repo
2. Launch index.html, no need to use local server, just open it in your browser
3. Answer Chatbot questions
4. The questions and answers are stored in your browser local storage
5. When finished, download your conversation by clicking 'Save conversation history'
6. Optionally click Clear log to clear conversation from local storage.
7. Save your conversation somwhere safe.


## TL;DR;
This open-source project aims to collect consensual information on people's traits, views, and beliefs to build a database. The database will be used to create chatbots, which will serve as digital replicas of people. The project aims to preserve human knowledge and wisdom for future generations.

# Open Humanity
## An early attempt to save as many minds as possible

## Problem
Unfortunately, humans are mortal beings, and there is currently no way to live past the age of 100. While there may be advancements in longevity in the future, we must accept our mortality as an inevitable part of life. However, we still want to leave a legacy behind us. We create art, write books, and contribute to the world in many ways to make a lasting impact.

Our great-grandparents left us diaries, our grandparents left us photos, and our parents left us videos. Now, we have the opportunity to leave something else behind.

## Solution

There are stories about people who have been turned into chatbots. With the current technology, it is possible to create a digital replica of a person. All we need is data.

## The Data

This project is not yet about code, but it eventually will be. Right now, we invite everyone, especially psychologists, sociologists, and philosophers, to create a list of questions. The list, when answered by an individual, will be sufficient to feed into a chatbot-making algorithm to create a persona as similar to the person as possible.

The persona will not be 100% identical, but with advances in AI, it will be sufficiently close. If all else fails and the world collapses, one can still leave their grandchildren answers to most philosophical or mind-boggling questions to see how their grandparents responded.

## About the format

New questions can be submitted through pull requests. All questions should be submitted in English in txt format, with a unique file name, hinting what the question is about, or a random unique string to avoid filename crashes.

We submit to the `/questions/uncategorized` directory, where questions will await categorization, except for NSFW questions that should go straight to the `/questions/nsfw` folder. If you know that your question should be inside a category that is not yet created, go ahead and create that category in the `/questions` folder.

## How to use

This project is in the early stages. To use it, clone this repo to your computer, create a folder `/answers`, and start answering all the questions. In my opinion, VSCode will help you greatly with browsing the questions, but feel free to use any text editor that you prefer.

Once you're done, backup those answers. Congratulations, you have just built up an information database that can be fed into a bot generation program to build a bot that will answer just like you do. You can either leave it as is, check for our #OpenHumanity updates, or use tools like `https://botmake.io/`, `https://www.appypie.com/chatbot/builder`, or ChatGPT.

In the `/instructions` folder, you can add instructions for how to use `/answers` to turn them into chatbots, either with the tools provided or with ones not yet known.

Join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/GZNdrpfk and share your opinions and findings with us.

## On Storing Answers

As the project grows, we plan to add the ability to store answers online and generate chatbots automatically from them. For now, if you want to keep your answers private, please make at least two backups on different devices or print them on paper. Alternatively, you can create a private GitHub repository and upload your answers there.

If you are willing to share your answers with us and have no issues with others reading them, you can upload them to the `/answers/<your_github_username>` folder. This way, we can use them once we have the software.

## Conclusion

Remember that life is worth living as it is now. If you have no one to chat with, feel free to reach out to us. We are glad to chat with you!

Have a nice day!

All the best!

Cheers!
